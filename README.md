# Character Soup

## Generates sequential brute-forced text.

A soup of characters. :tomato::corn::stew::cake:

### Supporting different languages:

- [x] JavaScript
- [x] TypeScript
- [ ] Python
- [ ] C#
- [ ] Java
- [ ] C++

#### :clock1: Benchmarking in development.

## How does it work?

```javascript
// Set the maximum text length:
const MAX_LENGTH = 4;

// Set the characters to be used:
const CHARACTERS = "0123456789";

// Create an array of all combinations,
// Total of c^(n!), c = |CHARACTERS|, n = |MAX_LENGTH|
// For example: ["0", "1", "2", ... , "9997", "9998", "9999"];
```

### What is character soup for?

Originally, this was one of the earlies pieces of software I wrote, in Visual Basic.
To illustrate how quickly it is to run through all 4-digit PIN codes.

Now, password systems are properly protected with reCAPTCHA, multi-factor authentication, password-entry limits and more.
It is still interesting to show how quickly a password can be brute-forced.

### Happy World Password Day to all! :calendar:

Not really.
But [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/936/ "There is an XKCD comic for everything") is always fun.
It is a good reminder to ensure:

- :lock: Your passwords are unique across all services.
- :lock: Your passwords aren't all "password".
- :lock: You are using multi-factor authentication where possible.
